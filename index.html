            <p>oCALM (with its aptly assigned initialism) is an organization devoted to promoting models of law including computers. It is based on the view that <strong>today's laws and their application depend entirely on human interpretation</strong>, and thus will <strong>struggle to adapt with technological progress at the same rate lawmakers will struggle to understand new technologies</strong>.</p>
            <p>By introducing models of law aided by computers, the hope is to produce <strong>standards which can be read and understood by those innovating and inventing and advancing technology</strong>, as well as any citizen, thereby reducing the barrier between those pushing laws to their limit and those writing the laws. oCALM's intention is to improve the level of understanding in laws applicable to citizens and innovators, in those same citizens and innovators of which those laws are applied.</p>
